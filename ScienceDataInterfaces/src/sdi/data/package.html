    Science Data Interfaces provide Java interfaces for commonly encountered
datasets.  These interfaces include examples such as Y(X) (often rendered 
as a line plot) and Z(X,Y) (often rendered as a spectrogram or color plot).  
These are immediately divided into two catagories: those with metadata and those
without.  The "Simple" versions are ones without metadata.  The others implement
the Described interface and provide additional metadata, such as labels and units.

   Note the data will often appear as lists of data.  For example, where the
   RPW Group uses BinnedData2D of changing geometry, a <pre>List<BinnedData2D></pre> should be
    used.
