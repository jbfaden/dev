    Science Data Interfaces provide Java interfaces for commonly encountered
datasets.  These interfaces include examples such as Y(X) (often rendered 
as a line plot) and Z(X,Y) (often rendered as a spectrogram or color plot).  
These are immediately divided into two catagories: those with metadata and those
without.  The "Simple" versions are ones without metadata.  The others implement
the Described interface and provide additional metadata, such as labels and units.
