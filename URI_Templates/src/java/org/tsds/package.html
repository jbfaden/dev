        Time Parsing and Generation methods, and utilities for handling times.
        The TimeParserGenerator class uses templates for parsing time strings
        and filename granules that contain data for a time interval, and will
        generate times as well.  TimeUtil also contains methods for parsing and
        formatting ISO8601 times and time ranges.
